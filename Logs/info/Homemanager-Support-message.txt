Please note that I will soon switch Nyx from a Home Manager module to a NixOS module.
You can still use the Home Manager module, but I will only continue developing it for Nyx at a specific legacy commit/revision.

Please consider pinning Nyx to that commit:
[https://github.com/Peritia-System/Nyx-Tools/blob/main/Documentation/How-to-Homemanager.md](https://github.com/Peritia-System/Nyx-Tools/blob/main/Documentation/How-to-Homemanager.md)

If you use this, you can keep the current version indefinitely but won’t receive updates.
If you don’t pin to that commit, I won’t take any responsibility for breakage.
(Note: I don’t take any responsibility regardless — this is a hobby project.)
If you want to ensure it works, help me develop it.

Thank you for your understanding <3

This is not supposed to discourage you from using Nyx!!! I am so, so glad you use Nyx :)
But it is very early in development so things move quick and big changes will be common.
Plus as I said, it is a hobby project and at the moment I develop alone.
